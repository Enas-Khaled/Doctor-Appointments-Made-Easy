# Doctor Appointments Made Easy!

## Project Description
Doctor Appointments Made Easy! is a system designed to efficiently schedule and manage doctor consultations. The application leverages programmatic development techniques to implement a structured workflow for handling appointment requests, doctor approvals, invoicing, and feedback collection. The goal is to streamline the process for patients, doctors, and hospital staff.

## Features

## Technologies Used
- **Back-End:** SQL, PL/SQL
- **Front-End:** HTML, JavaScript, CSS

## Workflow
The system follows a structured, step-by-step workflow to manage appointments. Key steps include:
1. Patients request appointments through hospital staff.
2. Doctor availability is checked automatically.
3. Notifications are sent for approvals or rejections.
4. Invoice management for new or follow-up visits.
5. Appointment confirmations and feedback collection.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Workflow Automation:** Designed SQL and PL/SQL scripts to handle complex logic for conditions and sequences.
- **Role Management:** Developed secure login mechanisms for different user roles.
- **Front-End Integration:** Used JavaScript for dynamic UI elements.

## Lessons Learned
- Deepened understanding of workflow automation and database-driven applications.
- Enhanced front-end development skills with CSS and JavaScript.

## Next Steps
